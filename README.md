# Beware the Siren
This is a prototype of a 2.5D side-view pirate game set in a mysterious sea under the control of a evil siren.

*Note: Beware the Siren is still under developement!*

## Synopsis
You sail across the seas on your pirate ship, battling the siren’s minions who try to keep you away from her. Using melee or ranged weapons, you defeat enemies and earn experience points. 
Each level-up grants you a skill point, which you can spend in your skill book on either passive or active abilities. Skill points can be adjusted at any time. 
Once the final enemy is defeated, there’s a chance they’ll drop a new weapon, unlocking new possibilities and abilities for you.
